# Paracrine-Signal-Diffusion
Proof of concept first in 1D with some notes on programming on the GPU (see https://github.com/jweswimm/Paracrine-Signal-Diffusion/blob/main/writeups/proofofconceptwriteup.pdf). This repo also contains the the pytorch implementation of the 3d diffusion problem, along with the corresponding 3d CUDA paracrine code. Because our group is still working on this code and in the process of writing papers, I can't release the entire cuda code publicly. The paracrine.cu and paracrine.cuh codes should give a decent understanding of the type of code we are writing.
