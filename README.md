# Paracrine-Signal-Diffusion
Proof of concept first in 1D with some notes on programming on the GPU (see https://github.com/jweswimm/Paracrine-Signal-Diffusion/blob/main/writeups/proofofconceptwriteup.pdf). This repo also contains the pytorch implementation of the 3d diffusion problem from nonuniform sources, along with the corresponding 3d CUDA paracrine code. Because our group is still working on this CUDA code and in the process of publication, I can't release the entire cuda code publicly. The paracrine.cu and paracrine.cuh codes should give a decent understanding of the type of code we are writing.
